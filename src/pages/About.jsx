            Welcome to Nike, your trusted partner in product testing and market research. 
            As a Tester with us, you have the opportunity to get paid for carrying out fiscal market research

            Our goal is to evaluate the efficiency of the human resources of various retail networks across 
            the U.S., including the Nike Store, CVS, and Walmart, with minimal supervision. Your role as a 
            Tester involves walking into these outlets and carrying out your assignments as a normal customer 
            would, without hinting at the fact that you're a secret shopper/surveyor.

            As a Tester, you earn $300 for each completed job, plus free Nike products. You will receive at 
            least 2 surveys per week, providing ample opportunities to earn and contribute valuable feedback.
        </p>

            develop new products or services and enhance existing ones.
